Project Title: Responsive Portfolio

Purpose: My purpose was to create a website showcasing myself and m projects that I will be making in the future. My goal is to make sure that the website is responsive to the users that are interacting with it and make sure all the webpages are connected to one another.

What was done:
-four .html pages were created to represent the four sections of the webpage. The about and home page are page are both the same and have identical code. 

-created a navbar with about(home), portfolio, contact

-the navbar.css file is referenced and used on all four pages

-the navbar.css file was edited to change the font of the entire webpage and how much space that the navbar wil take in the page. The navbar properties that were edited were the font size of the content in the navbar, the line height, and float.

-the contact page was edited first using a card class to split up the name, email, and message sections so that the user can submit their resoponses

-the portfolio page was created in a similar fashion as the contact page using a card layout. The card layout was the duplicated four times in order to hold the place of four projects.

-the portfolio page was editied to have the images act as hyperlinks and redirect to another webpage.

-the about page was created without the use of card but by box-model sectioning mainly with the use of css. The page contains an image and a short paragraph

-the about page html was duplicated exactly onto the index.html file

-style.css applied to only the about.html and index.html pages.

-style.css adjusts the properties so that the About Me is aligned to the left side of the page, doesn't extend the full width of the webpage, float the image to the left, controls the size of the photo, and controls the size and color of the box and it's borders
